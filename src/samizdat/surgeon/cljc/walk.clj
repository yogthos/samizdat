  "Reader-conditional-aware top-level walker.

   Pre-existing ops (outline, intra-ns-deps, mv, extract, fix-declares) walk
   top-level via `z/right` and only consider `(z/list? zloc)`. Forms wrapped in
   `#?(:clj ...)` / `#?@(:clj [...])` are reader-macro nodes (not lists) and
   are silently skipped — meaning a CLJC file's CLJ-only `(defn ...)` is
   invisible to the rest of the toolchain.

   This namespace provides one helper that yields every top-level *form* in a
   CLJ/CLJS/CLJC source paired with the set of platforms it lives under.

   Pure: takes a string + the all-platforms set, returns data."
