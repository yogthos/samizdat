  "Checked manifest edits — the manifest-editing analog of a compiler patch.
   Ops work on the *raw* manifest (the EDN as written: :fragments, :pipeline
   and :schema :inherit intact), rewrite every reference to a cell, and the
   result is expanded + validated with the full manifest validator before the
   caller ever sees it. An optional expect-hash guard rejects stale edits.

   `render` writes the patched map back over the original text with a minimal
   diff, so comments and layout survive — the EDN file is the human-readable
   projection, and a checked edit must not reformat it. Map edits are done by
   key *position* on the rewrite-clj node tree: in an edge map like
   {:start :delete, :delete :end} the key :delete and the value :delete must
   never be confused.

   samizdat's copy differs from upstream in what a manifest can be: the
   WORKFLOW dialect (bare-keyword cells resolved from the registry, compiled
   by mycelium.workflow) alongside the self-describing one, an `:invariants`
   section that names cells the way `:constraints` does, and a `:validator`
   seam so the caller's compiler is what accepts or refuses the result.
   Vectors of equal length render element-wise, so a rename inside
   :invariants does not reprint every paragraph of prose in it."
