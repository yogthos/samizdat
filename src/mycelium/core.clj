  "Invoke a single registered cell directly, outside of a workflow.

  Useful for read-shaped routes that orchestrate one or two cells, for

  isolation without standing up a workflow.

  Validates by default:
    1. The cell exists in the registry.
    2. Every key in the cell's :requires vector is present in resources.
    3. data conforms to the cell's :input schema (if declared).
    4. The handler's return value conforms to the cell's :output schema
       (if declared). Per-transition output schemas are matched against
       the returned :mycelium/transition or against any branch when
       transition is unspecified.

  Returns the handler's result on success.
  Throws ex-info on validation failure with a `:type` key naming the
  failure mode:

    :mycelium.invoke-cell/cell-not-found
    :mycelium.invoke-cell/missing-resources
    :mycelium.invoke-cell/input-error

  Returns a future that runs the worker loop. The loop continues until
  the future is cancelled. Each task is claimed, executed, and completed
  or failed based on the result.

  Resume: when task data contains :mycelium/session-id, the worker uses
  :resume-load, :resume-save, and :resume-delete callbacks to manage
  halted workflow state. See `mycelium.store/start-worker-with-store`
  for a convenience wrapper that supplies these from a WorkflowStore.

  Halt handling: when a workflow halts (returns :mycelium/resume):
  - With :on-halt: checks claimed? first to guard against stale leases,
    then invokes (on-halt result) and passes the return value to complete!.
  - Without :on-halt: dead-letters the task with a descriptive error.

    :worker-id      — string identifying this worker (default: auto-generated)
    :poll-ms        — ms to sleep when queue is empty (default: 1000)
